  In this post, we will be looking at the most popular different RDP Properties we can use in Azure Virtual Desktop.  will be talking about local PC's and remote PC's alot, where the remote PC is of course the Azure Virtual Desktop host and the local PC is the device you can physically touch.

## What are RDP properties?

RDP properties are specific settings to change your RDP experience. This can be to play sound on the remote or local PC, enable or disable printer redirection, enable or disable clipboard between computers and what to do if connection is lost.

In the previous years, this was also the case for normal RDP files or connections to Remote Desktop Services, but Azure Virtual Desktop brings this to a nice and centralized system which we can change to our and our users' preference.

## How to configure RDP properties

The 3 most popular RDP properties which I also used a lot in the past are these below.

### Clipboard redirection

*redirectclipboard:i:0*

This setting enables or disables if we are allowed to use the clipboard between the local PC and the remote PC. We can find this on the tab "Device redirection":

[![jv-media-4401-e9aca44e07ad.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/azure-virtual-desktop-rdp-properties-4401/jv-media-4401-e9aca44e07ad.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/azure-virtual-desktop-rdp-properties-4401/jv-media-4401-e9aca44e07ad.png)

The default option is "disabled", so text and files are not transferable between computers. Enabling this means that users this can do, but we trade in some security. We can configure this in the Azure Portal GUI or by changing the setting on the "Advanced Settings" tab.

### Display RDP connection bar

*displayconnectionbar:i:0*

We can hide the RDP connection bar by default for users. They can only bring it up with the shortcut "CTRL+ALT+HOME". This makes the user experience a bit better as they don't have that connection bar in place for the whole session. By default, this option is enabled, so 1.

There is no way to configure this in the GUI, only through the advanced settings. This also doesn't have official AVD support but can confirm it works like expected.

### Drive redirection

*drivestoredirect:s:dynamicdrives*

Changing the drive redirection setting ensures that drives are only redirected when you want this. We can use the option "DynamicDrives" which only redirects drives that are connected after the RDP session is connected.

## My most used RDP settings

My full and most used configuration is here:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
audioqualitymode:i:2;displayconnectionbar:i:0;drivestoredirect:s:dynamicdrives;usbdevicestoredirect:s:*;redirectclipboard:i:0;redirectprinters:i:1;audiomode:i:0;videoplaybackmode:i:1;devicestoredirect:s:*;redirectcomports:i:1;redirectsmartcards:i:1;enablecredsspsupport:i:1;redirectwebauthn:i:1;use multimon:i:1;enablerdsaadauth:i:0;autoreconnection enabled:i:1;audiocapturemode:i:1;camerastoredirect:s:*;screen mode id:i:2
{{< /card >}}

Mostly the default configuration, but I like the Connection bar hided by default.

## The location to change RDP properties

We can find the RDP properties in the hostpool of your environment, and then on "RDP properties":

[![jv-media-4401-5784a654d692.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/azure-virtual-desktop-rdp-properties-4401/jv-media-4401-5784a654d692.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/azure-virtual-desktop-rdp-properties-4401/jv-media-4401-5784a654d692.png)

We can find the advanced options at the "Advanced" page:

## Summary

This page contains a lot of different RDP settings which we can still use today. Some of the RDP settings are categorized by Microsoft as not supported but will do their work in Azure Virtual Desktop too, for example the option to hide the connection bar by default.
