## Method 1: Settings Catalog

The easiest way to disable these widgets is through a Settings Catalog policy. Open up Microsoft Intune admin center and create a new policy through the Settings Catalog.

Search for "widget" and these options are available:

- News and Interests: Disable Widgets on Lockscreen
- News and Interests: Disable Widgets Board
- Widgets: Allow Widgets

In my case, I have set all three options to disabled/Not allowed.

After you have assigned this to the device, all Widgets options are gone and the user experience will be a bit better. The endpoint must restart to apply the changes.

## Method 2: Registry/PowerShell

You can achieve the settings also through PowerShell which does some registry changes. You can use this simple script:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
$JVRegPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Dsh"

# Checking/creating path
If (!(Test-Path $JVRegPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $JVRegPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# 1. Disable Widgets Board
Set-ItemProperty -Path $JVRegPath -Name "AllowNewsAndInterests" -Type DWord -Value 0

# 2. Disable Widgets on Lock Screen
Set-ItemProperty -Path $JVRegPath -Name "AllowWidgetsOnLockscreen" -Type DWord -Value 0

# 3. Disable Widgets on Taskbar
Set-ItemProperty -Path $JVRegPath -Name "AllowWidgets" -Type DWord -Value 0
{{< /card >}}

This sets 3 registry keys to the desired setting. In this case disabling widgets on the taskbar and lockscreen.

After these keys are set, the computer must reboot to apply the changes.
