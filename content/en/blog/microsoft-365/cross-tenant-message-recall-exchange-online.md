## How the message recall feature works

We have all been there. A email is sent and you forgot to add the attachment or the wrong recipient. Exchange Online already has the feature recall messages inside your own tenant but now the cross tenant recall feature is announced, meaning we can recall messages sent to external users which also use Microsoft 365.

Cross-Tenant Message Recall has two configuration steps:

1. A switch to enable or disable the feature
2. An allow list which controls which tenants can recall messages received in your tenant, where the advice is to only add tenants which you trust, like partners or sub-organizations. Like a whitelist of tenants you trust

According to Message Center notification **MC1423106** from 10 July 2026, the rollout is expected to begin across all clouds from mid-August 2026 and should be completed by early September 2026.

However, the feature is and will still be disabled by default but when the update has been done we can enable this by using this small steps.

## Step 1: Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell

We can connect to Exchange Online with Powershell using this command:

{{< card code=true header="**Bash**" lang="bash" >}}
Connect-ExchangeOnline
{{< /card >}}

If you don't have this PowerShell module yet, follow the steps on this page: [https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement)

You also need to have the newest version available which will contain the new Cross-Tenant message recall cmdlets.

## Step 2: Enable Cross-Tenant Message Recall

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Enabling cross-tenant recall and configuring allow list tenants changes how Message Recall requests are honored for messages delivered to your users. Review the allow list carefully before enabling.
{{% /alert %}}

After connecting to Exchange Online PowerShell, we can execute this command:

{{< card code=true header="**PowerShell**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-CrossTenantRecallConfiguration -CrossTenantRecallEnabled $true
{{< /card >}}

To disable the feature, run the command with the boolean at the end set to "false":

{{< card code=true header="**PowerShell**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-CrossTenantRecallConfiguration -CrossTenantRecallEnabled $false
{{< /card >}}

Cross-Tenant Message Recall is disabled by default, and no cross-tenant recall happens until an admin adds at least one tenant to the allow list.

## Step 3: Add allowed sender tenants (the allow list)

To allow other Microsoft 365 tenants to request recall for messages delivered to your organization, add their tenant ids to your allow list. Let's go through these steps.

To find the tenant ID of a tenant which sends email to your tenant (external) which can be done in multiple ways, but the most easiest is to visit [https://entra.microsoft.com/](https://entra.microsoft.com/). There you have the Tenant ID with a copy button next to it. Paste this tenant id in this command:

{{< card code=true header="**PowerShell**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-CrossTenantRecallConfiguration -AllowedSenderTenantIds @{Add="d136fa27-8883-4bf0-a9d2-c126cc7e3990"}
{{< /card >}}

In this step you will need to add the tenant ids of the external organizations in your allowed configuration, which means the external organization can recall messages sent to your organization.

## Summary

Cross-Tenant Message Recall lets us IT guys expand the Message Recall across Microsoft 365 tenant boundaries, but only when the receiving tenant explicitly allow-lists the sender’s tenant. The feature is disabled by default, so you must enable it and configure the allow list before partner tenants can successfully request recalls for messages delivered to your organization.

This way we can recall messages sent inter tenants to for example partners or sub organizations which is a pretty cool developement.
