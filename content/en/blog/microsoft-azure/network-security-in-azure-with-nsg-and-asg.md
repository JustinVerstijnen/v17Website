  When designing, managing and securing a network in Microsoft Azure we have lots of options to do this. We can leverage third-party appliances like Fortinet, Palo Alto, PFSense or Sophos XG Firewall but we can also use the somewhat limited built-in options; Network Security Groups (NSG for short) and Application Security Groups (ASG). In this guide I will explain how Network Security Groups (NSG) and Application Security Groups (ASG) can be used to secure your environment.

## What does an Network Security Group (NSG) do?

A network Security Group is a layer 4 network security layer in Azure to filter incoming and outgoing traffic which you can apply to:

- A single VM, you assign it to the NIC (Network Interface Card)
- A subnet, which contains similar virtual machines or need the same policy

In a Network Security Group, you can define which traffic may enter or leave the assigned resource, this all based on layer 4 of the OSI model. In the Azure Portal, this looks like this:

To clarify some of the terms used in a rule;

- **Source:** This is the source of where the traffic originates from. To allow everything, select "Any" but to specify IP-adresses select "IP-adresses".
- **Source port ranges:** This is the source port which the source uses. The best way is to leave this a "\*" so a client can determine its own port.
- **Destination:** This is the destination of the traffic. This will mostly be your Azure resource or subnet.
- **Service:** These are predefined services which use common TCP/UDP ports for easy creation.
- **Destination port ranges:** This is the port of the destination which traffic has.
- **Protocol:** Select TCP, UDP or ICMPv4 based on your requirements.
- **Action:** Select if you want to block or allow the traffic
- **Priority:** This is the priority of the rule. A number closer to zero means the rule will be processed first and priorities with a higher number will be processed in the order after that.

## Rule processing of NSGs

When having rules in a Network Security Group, we can have theoretically thousands of rules. The processing will be applied like the rules below;

- When applying a NSG to both the virtual machine and the subnet of the machine, the rules will stack. This means you have to specify all rules in both NSG's.
  - My advice is to use NSG's on specific servers on machine level, and to use NSG's on subnets when you have a subnet of identical or similar machines. Always apply a NSG but on one of the 2 levels.
- A rule with a higher priority will be processed first. 0 is considered the highest priority and 65500 is considered the lowest priority.
- The first rule that is matched will be applied and all other rules will be ignored.

## Inbound vs. Outbound traffic in Azure networks

There are 2 types of rules in a Network Security Group, inbound rules and outbound rules which have the following goal;

- **Inbound rules:** These are rules for traffic incoming from another Azure network or internet to your Azure resources. For example;
  - A host on the internet accessing your Azure webserver on port 443
  - A host on the internet accessing your Azure SQL server on port 1433
  - A host on the internet accessing your Azure server on port 3389
- **Outbound rules:** These are rules for traffic from your Azure network to another Azure network or the internet. For example;
  - A Azure server on your network accessing the internet via port 443
  - A Azure server on your network accessing a application on port 52134
  - Restricting outbound traffic by only allowing some ports

## NSGs of Azure in practice

To further clarify some practice examples I will create some different examples:

### Example 1:

When you want to have your server in Azure accessible through the internet, we need to create a *inbound rule* and will look like below:

[![jv-media-275-aa6561e3e871.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/network-security-in-azure-with-nsg-and-asg-275/jv-media-275-aa6561e3e871.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/network-security-in-azure-with-nsg-and-asg-275/jv-media-275-aa6561e3e871.png)

We have to create the rule as shown below:

A advice for opening RDP ports to the internet is to specify at least one IP-adress. Servers exposed with RDP to the internet are easy targets to cybersecurity attacks.

### Example 2:

When you want to only allow certain traffic from your Azure server to the internet, we need to create 2 *outbound rule*s and will look like below:

Here I have created 2 rules:

- A rule to allow outbound internet access with ports 80, 443 and 53 with a priority of 100
- A rule to block outbound internet access with all ports and all destinations with a priority of 4000.

Effectively only ports 80, 443 and 53 will work to the internet and all other services will be blocked.

## Application Security Groups

Aside from Network Security Groups we also have Application Security Groups. These are fine-grained, application-assigned groups which we can use in Network Security Groups.

We can assign virtual machines to Application Security Groups which host a certain service like SQL or webservices which run on some certain ports.

This will look like this:

[![jv-media-275-662d3b017e63.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/network-security-in-azure-with-nsg-and-asg-275/jv-media-275-662d3b017e63.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/network-security-in-azure-with-nsg-and-asg-275/jv-media-275-662d3b017e63.png)

This will come in handy when managing a lot of servers. Instead of changing every NSG to allow traffic to a new subnet or network, we can only add the new server to the application security group (ASG) to make the wanted rules effective.

To create a Application Security Group, go in the Azure Portal to "Application Security Groups" and create a new ASG.

[![jv-media-275-2121a73048bc.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/network-security-in-azure-with-nsg-and-asg-275/jv-media-275-2121a73048bc.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/network-security-in-azure-with-nsg-and-asg-275/jv-media-275-2121a73048bc.png)

Name the ASG and finish the wizard.

After creating the ASG we can assign a virtual machine to it by going to the virtual machine, and assign the ASG to it:

Now we have a Application Security Group with virtual machines assigned we can go and create a Network Security Group and define the new ASG in it:

After this we have replicated the situation like in the diagram above which will be future proof and scalable. This situation can be replicated for every situation where you have a set of identical machines that need to be assigned to a NSG.

## Summary

Network Security Groups (NSG)s are an great way to protect your Azure network on Layer 4 of the OSI model. This means you can configure any IP based communication with ports and such. However, this is no complete replacement of an Firewall hosted in Azure. A firewall can do much more, like actively block connections, block certain applications and categories and websites.

I hope this guide was interesting and thank you for reading.
