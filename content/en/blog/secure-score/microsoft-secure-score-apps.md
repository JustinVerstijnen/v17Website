  On this page, I will describe how I implemented my current Microsoft Secure Score on the Apps pillar. This means altering mostly the options of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 but also for Exchange Online, Teams and SharePoint. I have categorized all of the requirements, so the reader cam implement the settings very easily using the least administrative effort.
---

## Before we begin

I collected all the options of the Microsoft Secure Score for Apps on this page, and we I address them all. I also added some industry-accepted options which are not in the secure score framework but are really helpful in avoiding or minimizing attacks in your environment. You can use all options, or only a subset. The more of the options you implement, the higher your score.

Remember, having a secure score of 100% doesn't mean 100% security. This only means you are using 100% of the security toolbox of Microsoft.

At the start of this page, my current Secure Score overview looks like this:

[![jv-media-5293-cf5c9fb82ed1.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/how-i-bumped-up-microsoft-secure-score-towards-100-5293/jv-media-5293-cf5c9fb82ed1.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/how-i-bumped-up-microsoft-secure-score-towards-100-5293/jv-media-5293-cf5c9fb82ed1.png)

---

## The Apps recommendations

Let's check first which requirements we have to address. Go to <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore> and select Apps to only get the "Apps" category recommendations.

[![jv-media-5349-617a3b38a36a.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-617a3b38a36a.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-617a3b38a36a.png)

This gets us 56 recommendations, where around 20 are already addressed by the default settings. We still have 36 recommendations to so which we will do per application.

---

## The Exchange Online recommendations

We can select the Exchange Online recommendations only in the filter:

[![jv-media-5349-11890f91a865.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-11890f91a865.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-11890f91a865.png)

This are 8 recommendations which we will perform now. Most of these recommendations are setting which we will have to set. They can have impact on end-users so be aware of that.

[![jv-media-5349-377c5978938d.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-377c5978938d.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-377c5978938d.png)

## EO 1: Ensure 'External sharing' of calendars is not available

Go to the Exchange Online admin center: <https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com>

Then head to "Organization" and then "Sharing". Open the tab "Individual Sharing".

[![jv-media-5349-de25b3faca80.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-de25b3faca80.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-de25b3faca80.png)

Select the default Sharing Policy, then click on "Manage domains".

[![jv-media-5349-62150531109d.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-62150531109d.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-62150531109d.png)

Delete every rule and select the Anonymous rule. Then deselect every option and save the policy. This disables the possibility to share calendars and contacts with users from other tenants. This can be potentially dangerous and even leak (sensitive) data.

---

## EO 2: Ensure additional storage providers are restricted

This recommendation states that users are unable to use other storage providers in Outlook Web App. They can only use OneDrive/SharePoint after this is done.

This recommendation requires us to fire up Exchange Online PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.2.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-ExchangeOnline
{{< /card >}}

Then execute this command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity OwaMailboxPolicy-Default -AdditionalStorageProvidersAvailable $false
{{< /card >}}

This will if runned correctly give no feedback. You can then check if this worked like we wanted:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Get-OwaMailboxPolicy | Format-Table Name, AdditionalStorageProvidersAvailable
{{< /card >}}

This will return the actual state of this command.

[![jv-media-5349-57f301cb7e0e.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-57f301cb7e0e.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-57f301cb7e0e.png)

Keep the Exchange Online PowerShell window opened, as we have to do more in that PowerShell session.

---

## EO 3: Ensure MailTips are enabled for end users

MailTips are information boxes in Outlook that warn users about possible actions. For example; they will send an email to 300 recipients, or send email messages to external email addresses. With Mailtips enabled, Outlook will hint the user that this is not possible.

[![jv-media-5349-6d8c20f1e86c.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-6d8c20f1e86c.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-6d8c20f1e86c.png)

This recommendation requires us to fire up Exchange Online PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.2.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-ExchangeOnline
{{< /card >}}

Then execute this command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-OrganizationConfig -MailTipsAllTipsEnabled $true -MailTipsExternalRecipientsTipsEnabled $true -MailTipsGroupMetricsEnabled $true -MailTipsLargeAudienceThreshold '100'
{{< /card >}}

This command is now perfectly in line with the maximum outbound emails setting I described on the Identity page. Selecting more than 100 recipients will now warn the user that the email will be blocked. Perfectly in line with my recommendation here: <https://justinverstijnen.nl/?p=5338&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=5707#tip-3-restrict-amount-of-outbound-email-messages>

[![jv-media-5349-47bdd7e00510.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-47bdd7e00510.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-47bdd7e00510.png)

Keep the Exchange Online PowerShell window opened, as we have to do more in that PowerShell session.

---

## EO 4: Ensure mailbox auditing for all users is Enabled

Mailbox auditing ensures every action within a mailbox is audited. This is very useful for Shared Mailboxes where multiple users can access one single mailbox. For example; move or delete actions will be recorded.

This recommendation requires us to fire up Exchange Online PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.2.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-ExchangeOnline
{{< /card >}}

Then execute this command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-OrganizationConfig -AuditDisabled $false
{{< /card >}}

Then enable Auditing for every current shared mailbox:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Get-Mailbox -Filter * | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true
{{< /card >}}
[![jv-media-5349-fac29f9dd5a9.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-fac29f9dd5a9.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-fac29f9dd5a9.png)

Keep the Exchange Online PowerShell window opened, as we have to do more in that PowerShell session.

---

## EO 5: Ensure users installing Outlook add-ins is not allowed

This recommendations states that a user may not install any Outlook add-ins. These add-ins are mostly made by 3rd parties and are potentially harmful and can steal sensitive data from your users and organization.

To disable this, go to Exchange Online admin center: <https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com>

Then go to "Roles" and then "User Roles".

[![jv-media-5349-e265f3c7c236.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-e265f3c7c236.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-e265f3c7c236.png)

Click on the "Default Role Assignment Policy" and click on "Manage permissions".

Uncheck the following three options:

[![jv-media-5349-74c15a9389a1.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-74c15a9389a1.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-74c15a9389a1.png)

- My Custom Apps
- My Marketplace Apps
- My ReadWriteMailbox Apps

Then save the policy.

## EO 6: Ensure the customer lockbox feature is enabled

The Customer Lockbock feature is a feature that allows Microsoft Engineers to access your tenant and data in case of support is needed. Without this enabled, Microsoft will always have access to your data, of course using strict policies and security. This feature greatly enhanced data security of your tenant, and also those requests are audited.

It is true that before a support engineer can access your data, you must approve this access request and this request is given temporarily.

[![jv-media-5349-100ce96c3ba4.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-100ce96c3ba4.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-100ce96c3ba4.png)

This recommendation requires us to fire up Exchange Online PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.2.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-ExchangeOnline
{{< /card >}}

Then execute this command to enable it:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-OrganizationConfig -CustomerLockboxEnabled $true
{{< /card >}}

Or execute this command to disable it:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-OrganizationConfig -CustomerLockboxEnabled $false
{{< /card >}}

---

## The Microsoft Teams recommendations

We can find the Microsoft Teams recommendations in the same window by selecting "Apps" in the filter and then "Microsoft Teams":

[![jv-media-5349-d6f998f4f196.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-d6f998f4f196.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-d6f998f4f196.png)

---

## Teams 1: Only invited users should be automatically admitted to Teams meetings

This option disables that uninvited people can join your teams meeting. Only invited people can join your Teams meeting and are admitted automatically.

This recommendation requires us to fire up Microsoft Teams PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/7.3.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
{{< /card >}}

To see the status of this setting, run the following command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global | Format-List AutoAdmittedUsers
{{< /card >}}

Then execute this command to set the option to match the recommendation:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global -AutoAdmittedUsers InvitedUsers
{{< /card >}}
[![jv-media-5349-5f56c3242674.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-5f56c3242674.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-5f56c3242674.png)

Now only invited users will be admitted to the Team meetings.

Keep the MS Teams PowerShell window opened, as we have to do more in that PowerShell session.

---

## Teams 2: Configure which users are allowed to present in Teams meetings

This recommendation says that only the organizer of the meeting may present/share content in Teams meetings. This can reduce the risk of sensitive data loss.

This recommendation requires us to fire up Microsoft Teams PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/7.3.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
{{< /card >}}

To see the status of this setting, run the following command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy | Format-Table Identity, DesignatedPresenterRoleMode
{{< /card >}}

To actually restrict other users from presenting in your Teams meetings, run this command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global -DesignatedPresenterRoleMode "OrganizerOnlyUserOverride"
{{< /card >}}

Keep the MS Teams PowerShell window opened, as we have to do more in that PowerShell session.

---

## Teams 3: Restrict anonymous users from joining meetings

This recommendation restricts other users than invited users from joining your meetings. As Teams meeting URLs are public, they could be intercepted or accidentaly sent to 3rd parties. We want to restrict this for only the users we have invited.

This recommendation requires us to fire up Microsoft Teams PowerShell. You can install this module if you don't already have it: <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/7.3.0>

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
{{< /card >}}

To see the status of this setting, run the following command:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global | Select-Object AllowAnonymousUsersToJoinMeeting
{{< /card >}}

Then execute this command to set the option to match the recommendation:

{{< card code=true header="**POWERSHELL**" lang="powershell" >}}
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global -AllowAnonymousUsersToJoinMeeting $False
{{< /card >}}
[![jv-media-5349-12c17d365bed.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-12c17d365bed.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-12c17d365bed.png)

This now forbids uninvited users from accessing your Teams meetings.

{{< ads >}}

## The Microsoft SharePoint recommendations

We can find the Microsoft Teams recommendations in the same window by selecting "Apps" in the filter and then "SharePoint Online":

[![jv-media-5349-a0765653dc29.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-a0765653dc29.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-a0765653dc29.png)

These are only 2 recommendations we have to solve, which will take about 5 minutes.

---

## SharePoint 1: Sign out inactive users in SharePoint Online

The first recommendation states that we have to automatically sign-out inactive users from SharePoint Online. This means if they have the SharePoint Online window opened, they will be automatically signed-out after X time of inactivity.

We can configure this using the SharePoint Online Admin center. As administrator, head to <https://portal.office.com/sharepoint>

You will be directed to the SharePoint admin center. Open up "Policies" and then "Access control".

[![jv-media-5349-28e5b2fd8728.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-28e5b2fd8728.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-28e5b2fd8728.png)

Click on "Idle session sign-out". and enable this option.

[![jv-media-5349-9685a60bb044.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-9685a60bb044.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-9685a60bb044.png)

You can define yourself how strict this policy must be. The default is sign ou after 1 hour, but for businesses this could be somewhat short.

In my case, I will use the default options and save the settings.

---

## SharePoint 2: Ensure modern authentication is required

This recommendation states that if you use SharePoint Applications, the authentication being used must be Modern Authentication. For example, If you still had Office 2010 or older apps that do not support Modern Authentication, we can block this application from being used.

Now this sounds like something we already tackle using Conditional Access, but disabling this also on application level is a good idea.

We can configure this using the SharePoint Online Admin center. As administrator, head to <https://portal.office.com/sharepoint>

You will be directed to the SharePoint admin center. Open up "Policies" and then "Access control".

[![jv-media-5349-8a57ff0d5315.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-8a57ff0d5315.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-8a57ff0d5315.png)

Click on "Apps that don't use modern authentication".

Select "Block access" and save the settings to make them active.

[![jv-media-5349-61dde62bfd55.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-61dde62bfd55.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-61dde62bfd55.png)

---

## The Defender for Office 365 recommendations

For Defender for Office 365 recommendations, I enabled the Strict policies tenant-wide to do a great part of the job already, but I will also manually configure all of the recommendations to give a better understanding of what Microsoft has to offer.

[![jv-media-5349-e516f3e36483.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-e516f3e36483.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-e516f3e36483.png)

After that, let's take a look into the specific recommendations:

[![jv-media-5349-f27c2f40ef8b.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-f27c2f40ef8b.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-f27c2f40ef8b.png)

There are still around 20 items that have to be configured manually. I have categorized them by hand to make it easy to configure them all if you want. I also placed the headings of the policies so you can choose which requirement to configure.

### Safe Links recommendations

- **DO365 #1:** Create Safe Links policies for email messages
- **DO365 #2:** Ensure Safe Links for Office Applications is Enabled

### Safe Attachments recommendations

- ****DO365 #3:**** Turn on Safe Documents for Office Clients
- ****DO365 #**4:** Turn on Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in SharePoint; OneDrive; and Microsoft Teams
- ****DO365 #5:**** Ensure Safe Attachments policy is enabled
- **DO365 #6:** Turn on Safe Attachments in block mode

### Anti-phishing recommendations

- **DO365 #7:** Ensure that an anti-phishing policy has been created
- **DO365 #8:** Set the phishing email level threshold at 2 or higher
- **DO365 #9:** Enable impersonated user protection
- **DO365 #10:** Enable impersonated domain protection
- **DO365 #11:** Ensure that intelligence for impersonation protection is enabled
- **DO365 #12:** Quarantine messages that are detected from impersonated users
- **DO365 #13:** Quarantine messages that are detected from impersonated domains
- **DO365 #14:** Move messages that are detected as impersonated users by mailbox intelligence
- **DO365 #15:** Enable the user impersonation safety tip
- **DO365 #16:** Enable the domain impersonation safety tip
- **DO365 #17:** Enable the user impersonation unusual characters safety tip

### Anti-spam recommendations

- ****DO365 #18:**** Ensure all forms of mail forwarding are blocked and/or disabled
- ****DO365 #19:**** Ensure Exchange Online Spam Policies are set to notify administrators

---

## DO365 #1: Create Safe Links policies for email messages

This requirement wants us to create policies for safe links in email messages. This means that links you'll receive will automatically be scanned.

Open the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>)

Go to "Email & collaboration" and click on "Policies & rules", then click on "Threat policies"

[![jv-media-5349-273f25dc4ec4.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-273f25dc4ec4.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-273f25dc4ec4.png)

Then click on "Safe Links".

[![jv-media-5349-379758d03e41.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-379758d03e41.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-379758d03e41.png)

Create a new policy here. Give this a good name and description:

[![jv-media-5349-1ccfb4225d26.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-1ccfb4225d26.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-1ccfb4225d26.png)

Advance to the next page. My advice here is to link this to the "All Company" default dynamic group. This makes the policy active for newly created users and domains as well.

[![jv-media-5349-ad993259686c.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-ad993259686c.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-ad993259686c.png)

Click to the next page. Here is where all the settings are presented to you. Most of the default settings are okay which you can review. For my environment, I only enabled "Display the organization branding" at the bottom.

## DO365 #2: Ensure Safe Links for Office Applications is Enabled

Make sure you enable the Safe Links for Teams and Office 365 Apps at this page for requirement **DO365 #2**. Then click "Next".

[![jv-media-5349-6bb221d1cdcf.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-6bb221d1cdcf.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-6bb221d1cdcf.png)

On this page you could put in a custom text for your users for warning about links in their email before opening them and potentially harm their devices and accounts or even worse.

Then finish creating the policy, and that should be it for the first 2 requirements.

---

## DO365 #3: Turn on Safe Documents for Office Clients

This requirement wants us to enable a setting that enables Safe Documents for Office Clients. This setting can be found by following the steps below (or the fast pass: <https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2>)

Open the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>)

Go to "Email & collaboration" and click on "Policies & rules", then click on "Threat policies". Open the "Safe attachments" menu here.

Click on "Global Settings"

[![jv-media-5349-d9eeb0492738.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-d9eeb0492738.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-d9eeb0492738.png)

Enable this option and that should be it for this requirement.

## DO365 #4: Turn on Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in SharePoint, OneDrive and Microsoft Teams

If you are on this page already, also enable "Turn on Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in SharePoint, OneDrive and Microsoft Teams".

[![jv-media-5349-30f81504d7ee.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-30f81504d7ee.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-30f81504d7ee.png)

## DO365 #5: Ensure Safe Attachments policy is enabled

This requirement wants us to enable an Safe Attachments policy in our tenant. This means we configure what will happen to attachments sent through email and teams. Potentially malicious content can be removed and according to requirement DO365 #5, we must block this to get the highest secure score.

Open the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>)

Go to "Email & collaboration" and click on "Policies & rules", then click on "Threat policies". Open the "Safe attachments" menu here.

Create or modify an existing policy here.

[![jv-media-5349-90648171212f.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-90648171212f.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-90648171212f.png)

Give the policy a name and a description.

Advance to the next page. My advice here is to link this to the "All Company" default dynamic group. This makes the policy active for newly created users and domains as well.

[![jv-media-5349-ad993259686c.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-ad993259686c.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-ad993259686c.png)

Click "Next".

## DO365 #6: Turn on Safe Attachments in block mode

On the next tab we have to select the Block mode of Safe Attachments, and the best quarantine policy here would be AdminOnly.

[![jv-media-5349-41ca9b71a041.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-41ca9b71a041.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-41ca9b71a041.png)

Finish the policy and make sure its enabled.

## DO365 #7: Ensure that an anti-phishing policy has been created

Now we will have to create one policy to rule all anti-phishing requirements. This will also be the policy where we will configure all the anti-phising requirements in (DO365 #7-#17). You can also choose to create multiple policies, but for demonstration and managability, one policy is better.

This requirement wants us to enable mailbox intelligence and impersonation protection for email messages.

Open the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>)

Go to "Email & collaboration" and click on "Policies & rules", then click on "Threat policies"

[![jv-media-5349-273f25dc4ec4.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-273f25dc4ec4.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-273f25dc4ec4.png)

Then click on "Anti-phishing".

[![jv-media-5349-3c096cafea31.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-3c096cafea31.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-3c096cafea31.png)

Create a new policy here, and give it a good name and description, and click "Next".

[![jv-media-5349-26a59a9384a3.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-26a59a9384a3.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-26a59a9384a3.png)

Advance to the next page. My advice here is to link this to the "All Company" default dynamic group. This makes the policy active for newly created users and domains as well.

[![jv-media-5349-c0be3c703bf8.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-c0be3c703bf8.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-c0be3c703bf8.png)

Click "Next".

Set the Phishing email threshold to at least 3, and select the users/domains to protect using this setting. Ensure that the "Mailbox intelligence" setting is enabled.

[![jv-media-5349-18a6fdd7dec4.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-18a6fdd7dec4.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-18a6fdd7dec4.png)

Then create the policy.

## DO365 #8: Set the phishing email level threshold at 2 or higher

This requirement wants us to set the Phishing email slider to at least 2. In my environment, I have set this to 3.

[![jv-media-5349-6babe929eb9c.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-6babe929eb9c.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-6babe929eb9c.png)

## DO365 #9: Enable impersonated user protection

This requirement wants us to enable impersonated user protection. This enables us to decide what to do if impersonation happens and so true-like email is sent to our users.

Enable this setting here:

## DO365 #10: Enable impersonated domain protection

This requirement wants us to enable impersonated domain protection. This is somewhat the same as our users but then on domain-level.

Enable this setting here:

[![jv-media-5349-75ed2ac8172b.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-75ed2ac8172b.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-75ed2ac8172b.png)

You can also add custom domains to trust them also, or enable the 2 suboptions to make it active for all domains.

## DO365 #11: Ensure that intelligence for impersonation protection is enabled

This requirement wants us to enable the Intelligence option for impersonation protection, which can be found here:

[![jv-media-5349-a79faa4ef8e4.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-a79faa4ef8e4.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-a79faa4ef8e4.png)

Enable this option in your policy to get the score.

## DO365 #12: Quarantine messages that are detected from impersonated users

This requirement wants us to change the quarantine policy of messages received by impersonated users. These can be changed in the anti-phishing policy here:

## DO365 #18: Ensure all forms of mail forwarding are blocked and/or disabled

This requirement wants us to disable forwarding to outbound emailaddresses, which means email addresses outside of the organization/tenant.

Open the Microsoft Defender portal (<https://security.microsoft.com>)

Go to "Email & collaboration" and click on "Policies & rules", then click on "Threat policies". Open the "Anti-spam" menu here.

Click the "Anti-spam outbound policy" and make sure this setting is disabled:

[![jv-media-5349-a46651403ece.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-a46651403ece.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/microsoft-secure-score-apps-5349/jv-media-5349-a46651403ece.png)

You can also define here the limits of email that a user can send every hour/day. My advice is to limit this down to around 100 or 200. For more information about this: <https://justinverstijnen.nl/microsoft-secure-score-identity/tip-3-restrict-amount-of-outbound-email-messages>
