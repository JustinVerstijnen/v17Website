# Introduction to Analyzing Email Headers

When you troubleshoot mail flow, investigate phishing attempts, or validate spam filtering behavior, email headers are one of the most useful sources of information. Every email contains some hidden metadata (called the **Headers**) that shows how the message traveled across mail servers, which authentication checks were performed, and how spam filtering systems handled the message. This gives you an answer why that one mail ended up in the user's junk box.

In Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online environments, analyzing email headers is a common task for administrators and support engineers which must be performed regularly.

In this guide I will explain what email headers are, where to find them, what they contain and how to analyze them.

## What are email headers?

An email header is a simple metadata injected into an email message that contains technical information about the email message. This information is added by mail servers while the message travels from sender to recipient, travelling around the world wide web and contains some useful information to us IT guys.

Headers are not normally visible in Outlook or other mail clients until you open the message source or internet headers or know where to look in the clients. They are also saved in exported files like .MSG and .EML.

Some common details inside headers include:

- Sender and recipient addresses
- Reason why an email message ended in the Junk folder
- Message ID
- Mail server hops
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results
- Spam confidence levels
- Anti-spam verdicts
- Timestamps
- Routing information

An header is a big pile of text, and looks like this, but shortened to the first 20 lines:

I have some examples of full Email headers which I will explain later in this guide here:

## Important email header fields

In Email headers, we have some important fields which are basically in the big pile of text but can be opened visually in various tools like my Email Header Analyzer tool: [https://tools.justinverstijnen.nl/emailheaderanalyzer](https://tools.justinverstijnen.nl/emailheaderanalyzer)

[![jv-media-8528-91df4bf07e38.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-91df4bf07e38.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-91df4bf07e38.png)

Altough this contains a huge amount of information, we can basically extract some simple things from a header that tells us everything about an email message.

| Header | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery | Displays the delivery folder, Inbox or Junk |
| From | Displays the sender address shown to the user which can be spoofed |
| Return-Path | Shows the actual return address which cannot be spoofed |
| Received | Shows the route/hops the email traveled |
| Message-ID | Unique identifier for the message used as an identifier |
| Authentication-Results | SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation results |
| X-Forefront-Antispam-Report | Microsoft spam filtering details which gives more information about possible hits |
| X-Microsoft-Antispam | Additional Microsoft anti-spam information |

In Microsoft 365, the X-Forefront-Antispam-Report header is one of the most useful headers to check when investigating spam. Microsoft Defender adds several values here that show how the email was assessed.

For example, you can see the **Spam Confidence Level (SCL)**, whether Microsoft considered the message to be spam, phishing, or legitimate, and information about the sending IP address and the checks that were performed on the message.

## How to obtain email headers

Email headers can be exported at the receiving side, as this contains the route and the spam filtering actions by the recipient's email service. To effectively check what happened, you must obtain the headers from the recipient.

While this can be different for every client, I will show you where to find the headers in Outlook and Microsoft Defender.

### Outlook (New) and Web/OWA

Open the message, select the three dots (or right-click the message), select "View", and then select "View message details".

[![jv-media-8528-030f70747845.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-030f70747845.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-030f70747845.png)

Now you will be presented a huge load of text, called the Headers:

[![jv-media-8528-ac3c8e6b206b.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-ac3c8e6b206b.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-ac3c8e6b206b.png)

You can now copy all of this text and paste it into a Header Analyzer tool.

### Outlook Desktop (Classic)

Open the email, select "File", select "Properties", and copy the content from the "Internet headers" box.

### Microsoft Defender portal

Open the Microsoft Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com, go to "Email & collaboration", select "Explorer", open the message, and review the message details and headers.

[![jv-media-8528-e82fccf50155.png](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-e82fccf50155.png)](https://sajvwebsiteblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/blog/introduction-to-analyzing-email-headers/jv-media-8528-e82fccf50155.png)

Please note that you could only do this for received messages as sent messages will not contain the route and anti spam scores and behaviour.

## SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results

Modern email security heavily depends on email authentication.

These results are commonly stored inside the `Authentication-Results` header.

### SPF

SPF validates whether the sending mail server is authorized to send email for the domain.

Example:

```
spf=pass
```

A failed SPF result can indicate spoofing or an incorrectly configured sender domain.

### DKIM

DKIM validates the digital signature attached to the message.

Example:

```
dkim=pass
```

This helps verify that the email content was not modified during transport.

### DMARC

DMARC combines SPF and DKIM alignment checks and determines how receiving systems should handle failures.

Example:

```
dmarc=pass
```

A DMARC failure can explain why messages are quarantined or marked as suspicious.

## Analyzing Microsoft anti-spam headers

Exchange Online and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 add several additional headers to incoming messages.

One commonly analyzed value is the Spam Confidence Level (SCL).

| SCL Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| -1 | Bypassed spam filtering |
| 0-1 | Not spam |
| 5-6 | Spam |
| 9 | High confidence spam |

You may also see verdict values such as:

```
SFV:SPM
```

This indicates Microsoft classified the message as spam.

Another example:

```
SFV:SKS
```

This indicates the message skipped spam filtering.

These values are commonly used during investigations when users report missing emails or false positives.

## Using an email header analyzer

Raw email headers can be difficult to read because they often contain hundreds of lines.

To simplify this process, you can use an analyzer tool that parses the headers into readable sections.

I created a free tool for this purpose:

https://tools.justinverstijnen.nl/emailheaderanalyzer

The tool helps you quickly identify:

- Mail routing hops
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results
- Sender IP addresses
- Spam filtering information
- Suspicious indicators

You simply paste the raw email headers into the analyzer and review the parsed output.

This can significantly speed up troubleshooting and phishing investigations.

---

## Summary

Email headers provide detailed technical information about how a message was processed and delivered. By understanding headers such as `Received`, `Authentication-Results`, and Microsoft anti-spam headers, you can troubleshoot mail flow issues, investigate phishing attempts, and validate spam filtering behavior more effectively.
